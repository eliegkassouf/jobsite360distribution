# Why Download/Install/Bookmark JobSite360? 🤨
## Mobile 📱
- Better performance when seperated from web browser.
- Runs in fullscreen like a native app.

## MacOS/Windows 💻🖥
- Launching the application in it's own environment allows it run independently. 
- MacOS uses the native WebView which is already decent for performance.
- Windows 7+ App includes it's own built Chrome Runtime Engine (WebKit) not Internet Explorer OR Edge!

**Why Chrome Runtime/WebView (WebKit)?**
- JobSite360 Application can run on many platforms because it's built using Angular V14. 
- Once compiled for **production** it can be deployed virtually anywhere using an existing web browser framework.
